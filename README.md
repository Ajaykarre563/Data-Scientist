# License Plate Detection and Recognition

Tools & Technologies used: Python, OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, YOLO, Roboflow, OCR (Tesseract/Hugging Face).

Project Overview: This project focuses on detecting vehicle license plates from images and extracting text using machine learning and computer vision techniques. It involves training a YOLO model for detection and using OCR for text recognition.

# Key Steps:

Data Processing – Load and preprocess images, apply bounding box annotations.

Model Training – Train a YOLO model on labeled license plate images using Roboflow.

License Plate Detection – Detect plates in input images using the trained model.

Text Extraction – Use OCR techniques to extract alphanumeric text from detected plates.

Post-Processing – Clean and refine extracted text for accuracy and consistency.

Goal: To accurately detect and recognize license plate numbers from car images for applications like automated toll collection, surveillance, and traffic monitoring.
